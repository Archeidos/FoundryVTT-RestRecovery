# Short Rest Recovery
This module adds support for Wizards' Arcane Recovery and Land Druids' Natural Recovery within the short rest dialog.

If the Arcane/Natural Recovery Feature does not have any uses remaining or if there are no spell slots to recover, the spell slot UI shown in the above image will be hidden.

## Module Settings
* **Quick-roll Hit Dice**
  * If this setting is enabled, it will make it so that when you press the "Roll" button on the short rest UI, no hit dice dialog will be prompted, and the hit dice will be rolled immediately.


## To-do:
- ~~Hide spell slot recovery checkboxes when user has all spell slots~~
- ~~Add support for Land Druids' Natural Recovery~~
- Add support for Wizard/Druid multiclass (fml...)
